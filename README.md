# cocoapods-xcodify

This plugin allows you to produce a throw-away Xcode project based on your podspec, so that library consumers can integrate that without using CocoaPods and you don’t have to spend time maintaining a feature you don’t use.

## Installation

    $ gem install cocoapods-xcodify

## Usage

    $ pod xcodify NAME.podspec
